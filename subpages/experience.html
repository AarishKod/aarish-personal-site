            Volunteer at Journey Found - a nonprofit dedicated to helping
            disabled adults lead meaningful lives. During this period, I
            assisted with the creation of geolocations for employee tracking,
            helped develop a new scheduling program to adhere to new union
            contracts, and managed a portion of communications between workers
            in the field and managers back in the hq.
